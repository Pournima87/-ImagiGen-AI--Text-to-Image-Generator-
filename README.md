# ImagiGen-AI--Text-to-Image-Generator-
ImagiGen AI is a web-based app that generates images from text prompts using FalAI’s API. Built with CSS, TypeScript &amp; JavaScript, it features a simple UI, real-time generation, and image download support. A creative tool blending frontend tech with AI.

Existing AI-based image generation tools often require significant processing power or complex installations. This project addresses these challenges by providing a lightweight, browser-based solution that seamlessly interacts with OpenAI’s API (FALAI). Users can input textual descriptions, and the system quickly generates corresponding images, making it useful for designers, content creators,and developers.

Similar projects in AI image generation exist, such as DALL·E and Stable Diffusion. However, this project focuses on simplifying the process and enhancing accessibility, making it easier for users to experiment with AI- generated visuals.
